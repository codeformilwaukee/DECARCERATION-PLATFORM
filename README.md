# DECARCERATION-PLATFORM
# Description
This project (1) equips service providers with the tools they need to have a positive network effect and build and maintain awesome impact within and across communities, AND (2) to equip post incarcerated individuals with a single tool that guides their reentry journey so they can lead lives of purpose and positivity in their communities and families.

We believe that many reentry organizations nationally could have a more transformative impact on mass incarceration if they are provided with more incentives, reminders, and notices to collaborate as well as if they had fewer gates to reach the individuals they wish to help. We also believe many people formerly incarcerated can and will lead law-abiding lives if their reentry journeys were filled with less hurdles, more positivity, and clearer tasks. Therefore, we seek to create a platform that meets those needs.

# Installation
This project uses NPM and was started with create-react-app.

Once cloned, running a ```npm install``` in ```web-app/``` followed by ```npm start```, a development version of the website app will open in your browser.   

# Usage
Navigation can be done by appending routes to the end of the url in browser currently, those routes are defined in ```web-app/src/routes.js```.
Currently implemented routes:
* /signup
* /signin
* /calendar
* /home
* /services
* /privacypolicy
* /termsandconditions

Screenshots will be included in the next sprint.
