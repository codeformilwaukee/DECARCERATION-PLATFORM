            <Typography gutterBottom>A Wisconsin with connected resources to create effective alternatives to and within the criminal justice system to promote healthy and peaceful communities.</Typography>
            <Typography variant="h3" component="h3" gutterBottom>MISSION</Typography>
            <Typography gutterBottom>The mission of the Wisconsin Decarceration Platform is to foster collective action for positive change in the lives of those impacted by the justice system. We are a self-organizing anti-mass incarceration community, providing a digital safe place for service providers, advocacy organizations, and affected individuals to connect with each-other and those in need of post-conviction services. We strive for equity by promoting a culture of learning, agency, and human dignity to encourage collaboration and transformation.</Typography>
            <Typography variant="h3" component="h3" gutterBottom>ORGANIZATIONS INVOLVED</Typography>
