            <Typography variant="h3" component="h3" gutterBottom>MISSION</Typography>
            <Typography gutterBottom>The mission of the Wisconsin Decarceration Platform is to foster collective action for positive change in the lives of those impacted by the justice system. We are a self-organizing anti-mass incarceration community, providing a digital safe place for service providers, advocacy organizations, and affected individuals to connect with each-other and those in need of post-conviction services. We strive for equity by promoting a culture of learning, agency, and human dignity to encourage collaboration and transformation.</Typography>
            <Typography variant="h3" component="h3" gutterBottom>ORGANIZATIONS INVOLVED</Typography>
            <Typography gutterBottom>The WDP was conceptualized in 2018 and has been in development for the past two years by a collaborative group of community members, philanthropists, activists, and academics from MSOE, UWM, Marquette University, Wisconsin Justice Initiative, Project RETURN, WISDOM, EXPO, the Milwaukee Turnersâ€™ Confronting Mass Incarceration project, Community Advocates, and many more Wisconsin organizations. </Typography>
